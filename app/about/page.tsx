          TechLifePortal is a local discovery platform built to help people
          find weekend spots, cafes, gyms, PGs, jobs, and experiences —
          all in one place.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
          We use AI to continuously discover new places and opportunities,
          but every listing is reviewed and approved by humans before
          it goes live.
        </p>

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          Our goal is simple: make local discovery easier, trustworthy,
          and more relevant.
